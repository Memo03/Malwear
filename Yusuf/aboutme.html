    <h4 class = "text" id="boxus">For our clothing company, Malwear, we focus on and vouch for diversity in the tech industry. Throughout the years, gentrification has been a huge issue and topic. Gentrification has affected many communities and has resulted in a large divide between social classes and ethnicities. The tech industry is a huge factor in the rise of gentrification. The technology industry has been on the rise and continues to grow with no sign of stopping. However, many tech companies are dominated by one race and they lack diversity. A solution to this problem is offering coding classes and programs. One example of these coding classes is Mission Bit. Mission bit is an organization that focuses on teaching the youth how to program. Mission Bit teaches a wide range of unexperienced teenagers from all types of income and ethnicities.

        I am 17. I watch and play video games and I enjoy working with css, and I love drawing. I also edit photos in photoshop. I was first introduced to coding, specifically HTML and CSS, in my Sophomore year of High School, when I took a class called Script Ed. This taught me the basic components in building websites, which has influenced me and my journey in code, to join the Mission Bit Web Design class, where I am working to grow my experience in coding. I am now entering my Senior Year of High School. I cannot live without design! Creating a certain design in anything gives its own uniqueness to a product. I love playing around with software to create aesthetic designs. Because of this, CSS is my favorite coding language.

      <h4 class="text">I am 18. I play sports and video games, I like reading and writing, and I enjoy coding and working on financials and business planning. I first started code when I joined the Mission Bit Web Design class, and the Dev/Mission class. In both, I have been learning the key components on how to build websites, system units and laptops. I am a rising Freshman in college. I cannot live without entertainment! I love watching movies, cartoons, anime and videos in general. I also love playing video games and reading books, and I am always looking for new puzzles and problems to solve.

      <h4 class="text">I am 16. I love hanging with friends and chillin with my family. I enjoy playing video games and I want to learn how to make them. This is my first year of coding, and prior to Mission Bit, I had no experience. I am going into my Senior year of High School. I cannot live without money. I am always looking for new challenges and how to make money and turn a profit. This why I joined this group, to create another new opportunity to make money. I cannot live without money because all of the fun things I want to do, and the things I have to do in life cost money. Money doesnâ€™t rule everything in this world, but it certainly has a play in a lot of things.
